    "    1. always synchronize before any work.\n",
    "    2. avoid having large changes, and modifying a few things simultaneously.\n",
    "    3. have a separate branch when working on a big change.\n",
    "    4. regularly merge changes made on the master onto another branch.\n",
    "    5. latest version on the master branch, and the stable version on another branch.\n",
    "    6. shouldnâ€™t rebase changes that have been pushed to remote repos.\n",
    "    7. good commit messages.\n",
    "2. **pull request**: request to repo owner to pull your changes. If there is a guideline, read it before the pull request.\n",
    "3. **fork**: creating a copy of the repo so that it belongs to us.\n",
    "4. Pull request workflow\n",
    "    1. forking\n",
    "    2. clone the repo to local\n",
    "    3. create a new branch\n",
    "    4. change in the new branch\n",
    "    5. `git push -u origin new_branch` \"-u\" sets `branch.<name>.merge` setting to let git know next time where to pull from\n",
    "    6. open a pull request on GitHub\n",
    "    7. you can change the pull request by commit changes on the same branch\n",
    "    8. if you want to create a new  pull request, you need to create a new branch\n",
    "5. interactive version of rebase\n",
    "    1. you can choose what kind of rebase you want to do\n",
    "    2. `pick` for usual rebase, `squash` for when you need to squashing changes into one commit\n",
    "    3. it will show a editor to let you edit commit messages after using squash\n",
    "    4. use `git push -f` to force push HEAD to remote repo\n",
    "6. issues tracker / bug tracker\n",
    "    1. bug tracking system like: Bugzilla\n",
    "    2. GitHub has an issue tracker too (Issues tag)\n",
    "    3. include `Closes: #4` or `Closes #4` in commit message or pull request to automatically close an issue when merged on GitHub\n",
    "    4. you can assign yourself to an issue on GitHub\n",
    "7. **continuous integration system (CI)**: a system that test the code every time there is a change.\n",
    "8. **continuous deployment/ continuous delivery (CD)**: deploying software more often makes it easier to catch and fix bugs.\n",
    "9. **pipelines**: specify the steps that need to run to get the result you want.\n",
    "10. **artifact**: any file generated as part of the CI/CD pipeline.\n"
